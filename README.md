# Classification-and-Analysis-of-GAP-Files-on-GitHub-using-AI
This repository comprises code for identifying repositories that uses GAP programming language, using a combination of machine learning, NLP and deep learning techniques. Additionally, it facilitates conducting comprehensive analysis on the collected data, enabling insightful observations.

## Functionalities Implemented 
- Scrape code files from GitHub 
- Preprocess the data for carrying out various techniques on them
- Come up with an ML approach to do distinguish whether a file belongs to GAP programming language
- Experiment with different models using ML, NLP and Deep Learning techniques
- Compare the performance of the models
- Perform insightful analysis on the filtered code files

## Getting Started
#### Install requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### cd into scripts/ directory
```
cd scripts/
```
#### Run the python script you want 
```
python *script_name.py*
```

## Best Practices 
- Check the issues section to find what to work on
- If new ideas come up, add it to the issues section as **enhancement**
- If any bugs are found, raise an issue
- When working on something, generate a new branch with an appropriate name and then do PRs once finished
