# Analysis-of-GAP-programming-practices-on-GitHub
This repository comprises code for classifying files as either GAP programming language or not, using a combination of heuristics and machine learning techniques. Additionally, it facilitates conducting comprehensive analysis on the collected data, enabling insightful observations.

## Functionalities to be Implemented (change this on the go)
- Scrape code files from GitHub 
- Preprocess the data for carrying out various techniques on them
- Come up with a heuristic approach to distinguish whether a file belongs to GAP programming language
- Come up with an ML approach to do the above
- Compare the two approaches (Heuristic and ML)
- Perform insightful analysis on the filtered code files

## Getting Started
#### Install requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### cd into scripts/ directory
```
cd scripts/
```
#### Run the python script you want 
```
python *script_name.py*
```

## Best Practices 
- Check the issues section to find what to work on
- If new ideas come up, add it to the issues section as **enhancement**
- If any bugs are found, raise an issue
- When working on something, generate a new branch with an appropriate name and then do PRs once finished
